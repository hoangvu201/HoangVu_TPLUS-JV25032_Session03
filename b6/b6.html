            <div class="content">
                <p>As you have used the different CSS selectors that only target either a class or an ID or a single element
                    for applying the styles. Nevertheless, CSS also allows making it incredibly easy for targeting more than
                    one element at a time to allow for specific CSS properties and rules. To do this, you have to separate
                    the selector's names with a comma, and you are good to implement CSS styles on many elements.
    
                    This is one of the coolest features of CSS, which is meant for greater code re-usability as there is no
                    ground for specifying the similar properties on some elements or classes separately when CSS has the
                    possibility to re-use them.</p>

                <p>CSS example: </p >
                <p>In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,</p>
                <p>h1 { font-family: sans-serif}<br>h2 { font-family: sans-serif}<br>h3 { font-family: sans-serif}</p>
                <p>is equivalent to:</p>
                <p>h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }</p>
